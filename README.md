# Baconian Cipher

Implementation of the Baconian Cipher, an early steganographic method developed by Francis Bacon.

## Cipher Description

The cipher replaces all letters in the message with a group of five letters, 'a' or 'b'.

Encoding a message is done by reversing the process.

## Example

```
Plaintext: Hello, World
Encoded:   aabbbaabaaababbababbabbbababbaabbbabaaabababbaaabb"
Decoded:   HELLOWORLD
```
